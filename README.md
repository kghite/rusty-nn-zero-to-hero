## Motivation

This is the source code for the Shallow Dives course on building neural networks from scratch in Rust, inspired by 
Karpathy's Zero To Hero course, and enabled by Candle, a minimalist ML framework for Rust developed by HuggingFace.

This course starts all the way at the basics of and progresses through developing and training Rust 
versions of micrograd, makemore, and nanoGPT as described in original Python repo here: [https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero)

Why learn Rusty ML? Full machine learning frameworks like PyTorch are very large, whereas Candle allows deployment of 
lightweight binaries and lets you remove Python from production workloads for drastically improved performance.

## Usage

You can follow along with this course by progressing through the interactive notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory - 
either within the [Shallow Dives course interface](example.com) or locally by cloning this repository and following 
the instructions in `notebooks/GettingStarted.md`.
